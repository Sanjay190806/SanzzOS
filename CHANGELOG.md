# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v1.7.2 - Stable Base Release

### Fixed
- Prisma environment loading consistency by routing root Prisma scripts through `backend/`.
- Windows Prisma generate recovery guidance with `npm run prisma:generate:safe`.
- PostgreSQL diagnostics now return safe host/user/database metadata without exposing passwords.
- Auth endpoints return safe 503 database errors instead of crashing when PostgreSQL is unavailable.
- Cloud sync endpoints return safe database-unavailable responses.
- Version mismatch across root, backend, frontend, and backup metadata.
- Backend health diagnostics now classify common PostgreSQL setup failures.

## v1.7.1 - Auth Stability + Google Sign-In

### Added
- Google Sign-In OAuth 2.0 integration with Authorization Code Flow
- Backend port conflict error handling with clear diagnostic messages
- Frontend backend health check on login/signup pages
- Google Sign-In button on login and signup pages with Google branding
- Provider field in User model (email/google) and providerId for Google users
- Google OAuth environment variables (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL)
- Backend Google auth routes (/api/auth/google, /api/auth/google/callback)
- Google auth service with secure token exchange and ID verification
- Auth callback page for handling OAuth redirects with error handling
- Provider badge in Account Settings panel showing auth method
- Last login timestamp display in settings panel
- Google OAuth setup documentation (docs/GOOGLE_AUTH.md)
- Improved error messages for network failures and HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 500, 503)

### Changed
- Updated auth types to include AuthProvider ('email' | 'google' | null)
- Updated AccountSettingsPanel to show provider and last login info
- Updated launcher script to check if backend is already running before starting
- Updated AUTH.md documentation with Google Sign-In information
- Improved API client error handling with specific messages for different status codes
- Made auth.service.ts publicUser function compatible with new provider field

### Fixed
- Backend now handles EADDRINUSE port conflicts gracefully with helpful error messages
- Frontend shows backend health status (online/offline) on login/signup pages
- "Failed to fetch" errors now show specific messages about backend reachability
- HTTP status codes now have user-friendly error messages
- Launcher script prevents duplicate backend instances

### Security
- Google OAuth uses Authorization Code Flow (secure, server-side)
- Google secrets never exposed to frontend
- ID tokens verified with Google's tokeninfo endpoint
- Email conflict checking prevents Google users from hijacking email accounts
- Service worker continues to bypass auth/cloud/sync API caching

### Database
- Added `provider` field to User model (default: 'email')
- Added `providerId` field to User model for Google user IDs
- Migration pending: Run `npx prisma migrate dev` when database is available

### Notes
- Prisma client needs regeneration after database is available (file lock prevented generation during development)
- Google Sign-In gracefully degrades if not configured (shows 501 error)
- Email/password and local-only modes continue to work without Google OAuth
- All existing v1.7.0 features remain stable

## v1.7.0 - Career OS Pro: Real Auth + Cloud Sync

### Added
- Real backend signup/login/logout/session restore endpoints.
- Account-owned cloud snapshot APIs, cloud backups, device tracking, and sync status.
- Local-to-cloud migration wizard with explicit upload/pull/local-only choices.
- Auth pages, onboarding flow, account settings, cloud sync settings, device management, cloud backup panel, and dashboard sync widget.
- AI command intents for account, sync, migration, device, backup, and security workflows.

### Changed
- Preserved legacy local/manual DB snapshot mode while adding authenticated `/api/cloud/*` routes.
- Service worker now bypasses auth/cloud/sync APIs and authorized requests.
- Backup registry includes safe account mode/device/onboarding metadata and continues to reject secret-like payloads.

### Security
- Removed fake authenticated frontend state.
- Cloud endpoints scope all data from authenticated user identity.
- Passwords are hashed with `crypto.scrypt`; plaintext passwords are never stored.
- Placeholder-only env examples include `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## v1.6.4 - Stability: Sync, Backup, PWA, Build

### Fixed
- Aligned frontend cloud sync adapter with backend routes (`/api/sync/health`, `/push`, `/pull`).
- Unified dual sync services under `syncCoreService` with compatibility wrapper in `services/syncService.ts`.
- Expanded backup export to 30 known localStorage keys via `backupRegistry.ts`.
- Safe restore: validation summary, pre-restore snapshot, secret rejection, schema checks.
- Mounted `PWAInstallPrompt` and `PWAUpdatePrompt` in `App.tsx`.
- Removed duplicate `manifest.json`; canonical manifest is `manifest.webmanifest`.
- Added PNG PWA icons and improved service worker shell caching.
- Added root `npm run build`, `check:all`, and frontend lightweight tests.

### Changed
- Sync UI now honestly labels local-first storage and manual DB snapshots.
- Settings distinguishes legacy career snapshot vs full backup panel.

### Security
- No tracked secrets; backup restore rejects secret-like payloads.

## v1.6.4 - Final Stabilization, Documentation & Production Release

### Changed
- Bumped version to `1.6.4` across root, `frontend/`, and `backend/` package manifests (backend was lagging at `1.6.1`).
- Expanded `routeConfig.ts` from 15 routes to 41 — now fully synchronized with all section IDs in `AppRouter.tsx`, grouped by feature domain with inline comments.

### Added
- `docs/SETUP.md` — comprehensive first-time setup guide covering prerequisites, environment configuration, Prisma workflow, and troubleshooting.
- `docs/FEATURES.md` — complete feature reference listing all 30+ modules, AI commands, localStorage keys, and PWA capabilities.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — expanded from a 676-byte stub to a full architecture document covering the frontend/backend split, persistence model, AI proxy pattern, sync layer, PWA strategy, and data flow.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` — expanded from a 364-byte stub to a full deployment guide covering local dev, Docker production compose, environment variable checklist, health checks, and rollback procedure.
- `docs/TESTING.md` — expanded from a 895-byte stub to a full QA testing strategy covering TypeScript compile gates, manual route regression checklist, AI command smoke tests, localStorage integrity checks, PWA offline tests, and backup/restore round-trip verification.
- `docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md` — replaced v1.0.0 report with the full v1.6.4 audit report (TypeScript pass, build pass, security scan, route coverage, 20-key localStorage inventory, notable findings, and sign-off).

### Fixed
- Removed `frontend/public/stress_seed.json` (178 KB dev fixture) from the production build output path — it was being served publicly in every deployment.
- Added `**/stress_seed.json` to `.gitignore` to prevent future re-addition; also untracked `docs/stress_seed.json` from git.

### Security
- Confirmed `backend/.env` (containing Groq API key) is not git-tracked. Key is correctly loaded from environment at runtime.
- Confirmed zero hardcoded API keys in any tracked frontend or backend source file.
- Confirmed `XSS` sanitization via `securityUtils.ts` is in place for all Markdown rendering paths.

### Quality
- TypeScript compile: **PASS** (0 errors, `tsc --noEmit`).
- Production build: **PASS** (32 lazy chunks emitted, 4.87s build time, `vite build`).
- Zero TODO/FIXME annotations remaining in `utils/` or `services/`.
